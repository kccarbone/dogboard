# Firmware

DogBoard is designed to be powered by an [Adafruit QT PY board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4900) sporting a [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) (RP2040). However, any QT PY that supports [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org) should be compatible. 

## Usage
Start by [installing CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-qt-py-2040/circuitpython) on your QT PY. Then simply upload the Python files in this folder. The board should restart automatically and start running the latest firmware.
